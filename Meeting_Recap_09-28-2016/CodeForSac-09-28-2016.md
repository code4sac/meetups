#### Zachary Townsend - CDO: State of CA 7:18 

* IBM, Abstracted out from Watson, Cognitive computing and cool AI problems associated with debate/persuasion 

* Prep work, open data, data-driven, management.  

* Trying to reform bad government proccess, and resolve the 'time tax' on those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged.  Proccess as a punishment.  

* Long term movement to open up data/make government/civic services more effective and improving people's lives. 

* 2 main threads: First thread: Open data, and open data portals, e.g. caltrans has a ton of data on traffic that is used by companies, and state government has data that is valuable to the public.  This data can be used for accountability and innovation.  

* data.ca.gov  3 areas of work: Federating/linking the data from/to other places (lots more portals), Releasing data from other departments that are up to standards and valuable, Strategic thinking on how to get more open data/working with departments to prepare data (for example: AB 1755, open water data) 

* Second thread: using data for operations for mesurable goals to be data driven.  What data could we have/do we have that we could use.  Making dashobards/making data dashboards public.  

* Skills gap, and hiring trends, and opportunities within state government.  More ways to serve the public

* The state has a ton of valuable data that can/could be unlocked 

* The future is still being planned out, but is focused on transparancey and making data meaningful.  


#### Questions:

* Q: Opportunities for civic tech companies, and what problems should be solved by government vs. startups?  

* A1: lots of opportunities, and tons of data, companies could be built based on data interpertation.  Plenty of big vendors, but startups have plenty of space to innovate.  E.g. New Child welfare system is an example of a place that could have a startup/info/data.  The state is trying to change the procurement proccess so that startups can compete.  

* A2: There is not an 18F equivalent inside CA gov, there is not a ton of internal development, likely all large IT systems will be procured around sacramento.  

* Q: Will they open the data on the accounting side of the government?  

* A: Office of the Controller already releases data on purchases etc...   Also need to make sure that we are gathering the correct data and that it's correct for the fiscal office.  The data that is being collected is noisy, and inaccurate.  

* Q: Meeting the governor, CTO, etc..

* A: Met the governor, etc...

* Q: Vision around the open data platform/ecosystem

* A: 3 things: 1.  Raw data available to analyze 2.  Apps built off the data and data that could be integrated into tools/open datasets.  3.  Data as a way to tell a story

* Q: Metrics for success?

* A: What is the value of the data that we're providing, not just quantity.  Would much rather have less but more valuable data, than more useless data.  

* Q: How is the open data program/intiative being recieved?

* A: Being recieved vey well through outreach both inside and outside of government.  The data is the last component on a list of cultural/process changes.  Spending lots of times with a variety of groups/stakeholders to see what people want and how to best meet their needs.  

* Q: What would the ideal data orginization look like? Centralized or case by case basis?  

* A: currently a hybrid approach within the state.  Should be a cultural shift to open up data/make accessible

* Q: What can we do to make sure that what we do does not die? 

* A: Still figuring out what sustainability looks like inside government.  We need to track metrics reliably (see the recent state auditors report)

#### 8:15 Standups

* SacSoS: Still collaborating with Sacramento homeless resources coalition.  SacSoS is an App to connect those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged with resources.  Have had 177 people use in the last 30 days.  70% are returning users, and 30% are new users.  Building in guidance/repeated themes/HOWTO guide.  Potential features data gathering/autocompletion of the forms, etc... Mostly found via world of mouth.  

* Tim Yoon - Food Insecurity Visualization, ongoing project and is in Washington DC/at the White House.  

* Beginning to work on Promise Zone resource mapping system.  The promise Zone is a Federal Designation that last 10 years that covers the low income areas of the city of Sac and where the Federal Government is focusing resources.  Sac County Housing Agency is the lead agency on that.  Also the UC Davis Center for Regional Change/the Data and Evaluation partner Bernadette Peters.
