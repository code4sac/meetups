### Joanne: 

* JavaScript Bootstrap 

## JavaScript Bootstrap Slide 1

* AirBerlin  Web Video/Web App YouTube demonstration

* Bootstrap is a framework/set of tools to build and put together structure via html, style via css and behavior via JS to build a website/web app

* Bootstrap will allow us to focus on HTML 

* Sites that use bootstrap include lyft, meteor, SacSOS.org 

## JS BootStrap Slide 2

* Adding boostrap to html, the first link is a link tag, right after the title tag to bootstrap.css 

* Bootstrap depends on JQuery and need to add a tag for that before the bottom /body html tag 

* The third tag is a bootstrap script tag for JS, just under the JQuery tag b/c the order matters

### JS Bootstrap Slide 3

* Adds responsive margins, centers/wraps content 

```HTML
<div class ='container'>
<h1> ... </h1>
<h2> ... </h2> 

</div> 
```

* This makes the site into a web app as the page is determined by screen size 

* you can also use the container-fluid class to all for streching on larger screens.
