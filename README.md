# Code for Sacramento Meetups
This is a code-free project repository for using GitHub issues to plan and manage our meetups. You can use Waffle cards ([learn more](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/blob/master/README.md)) or native [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/code4sac/meetups/issues).

### Workflow
All meetups should use the following workflow:
- [ ] Assign responsible Core Team member
- [ ] Confirm location
- [ ] Recruit speaker(s) or develop 30-45 minutes of content
- [ ] Draft meetup title and description
- [ ] Post and announce on [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/Code4Sac/) one week in advance
- [ ] Market and promote event via email blasts (monthly), social media, announcements at other meetups, personalized outreach to stakeholders, etc.
- [ ] Create slide deck to structure meetup experience
- [ ] Set up space 30 minutes prior to event (and recruit help if necessary)

**Congratulations, you've just facilitated an epic end-to-end meetup experience for our awesome community!**

### Rules of Thumb
- Beginning in 2016, we meet every Wednesday, 7p.m. at [The Urban Hive](http://www.theurbanhive.com/) by default
- Always welcome first-timers and go out of your way to make them feel part of the community
- We always need help organizing meetups, so please assign yourself liberally (if we share the workload, you should not have to manage more than one meetup per month)
- Please keep the meetup status regularly updated by checking off tasks (Hint: you can check the boxes in the Meetup Template) and using comments to share information and/or ask questions
